// Mode 3 of PROPOSAL_structured_microflow_description.md: render an irreducible
// but RECOMBINABLE graph by folding its branch guards into one condition,
// instead of flattening it into MDL that means something else.
//
// The approach is deliberately not a second describer. It rewrites a COPY of
// the graph into the equivalent properly-nested one and hands that to the
// describer that already exists, so Mode 3 inherits every activity renderer,
// annotation and layout rule for free and cannot drift from Mode 1. What the
// describer sees is an ordinary `if <folded> then … end if`.
//
// Opt-in, and that is load-bearing rather than a convenience: the output
// re-executes to a DIFFERENT graph — same behaviour, fewer nodes, different
// layout. Someone describing a microflow to change one activity must not have
// their canvas rebuilt as a side effect.
