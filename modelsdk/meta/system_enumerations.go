// The System module's built-in enumerations, as model elements.
//
// Like the entities, associations and Java actions beside them, these are NOT
// stored in the .mpr — Mendix ships them with the platform — so a reader that
// only decodes stored units reports them as absent. The definitions in
// SystemEnumerations had been here since #889 with no consumer at all, which is
// why `describe entity` could print `ActivityType: Enumeration(System.
// WorkflowActivityType)` while `describe enumeration System.WorkflowActivityType`
// answered "enumeration not found": the entity half was wired and the
// enumeration half never was (mendixlabs/mxcli#1102).
//
// Read-only. The System module has no stored unit to contain anything, so the
// executor refuses every write that names it — see refuseSystemEnumerationWrite
// in mdl/executor/cmd_enumerations.go, which exists because making these
// visible also makes them addressable.

// BuildSystemEnumerations returns the System module's enumerations as semantic
// model elements, ready to append to a backend's enumeration listing.
//
// IDs are deterministic, so two readers describing the same project agree about
// an enumeration's identity even though neither read it from storage, and the
// catalog (which keys enumerations_data on Id) stays stable run to run. Mirrors
// BuildSystemJavaActions.
//
// Captions are deliberately left unset: SystemEnumerations carries value NAMES
// only, and Mendix's own captions for these are not recorded here. Defaulting a
// caption to the value name would put invented text in DESCRIBE output and in
// the catalog's translation rows, where nothing could tell it from a caption a
// developer actually wrote. The cost is that `search` — which indexes captions —
// still does not match these; that needs real caption data, not a guess.
